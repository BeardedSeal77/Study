## üü¢ **BEGINNER LEVEL** - Start Here

### Example 1: Basic Interface
```typescript
interface Student {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  grade?: string;
}

const student: Student = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 20
};
```

<details>
<summary>üîç Click to see explanation</summary>

**What to say:**
"This code defines a Student interface with three properties: name as a string, age as a number, and an optional grade property indicated by the question mark. Then it creates a student object that implements this interface. Notice that grade is not provided, which is fine because it's optional."

**Key points to mention:**
- Interface defines a contract/structure
- Optional properties use `?`
- Object must match interface requirements
</details>

### Example 2: Simple Function
```javascript
function calculateTotal(prices) {
  let total = 0;
  for (let price of prices) {
    total += price;
  }
  return total;
}

const result = calculateTotal([10, 20, 30]);
```

<details>
<summary>üîç Click to see explanation</summary>

**What to say:**
"This function takes an array of prices and calculates the total sum. It initializes a total variable to zero, then uses a for-of loop to iterate through each price in the array, adding each price to the total. Finally, it returns the total sum. When called with [10, 20, 30], it will return 60."

**Key points to mention:**
- Function parameter and return value
- for-of loop syntax
- Accumulator pattern
</details>

### Example 3: Object Destructuring
```javascript
const person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 25,
  city: "New York"
};

const { name, age } = person;
console.log(name, age); // What will this print?
```

<details>
<summary>üîç Click to see explanation</summary>

**What to say:**
"This demonstrates object destructuring. We have a person object with three properties. The destructuring assignment extracts the name and age properties into separate variables. The console.log will print 'John 25'. This is a cleaner way to extract multiple properties from an object instead of writing person.name and person.age."

**Key points to mention:**
- Destructuring syntax with curly braces
- Creates new variables with same names as properties
- Cleaner than dot notation
</details>

## üü° **INTERMEDIATE LEVEL** - TypeScript Focus

### Example 4: Generic Function
```typescript
function findById<T extends { id: number }>(items: T[], id: number): T | undefined {
  return items.find(item => item.id === id);
}

const users = [{ id: 1, name: "Alice" }, { id: 2, name: "Bob" }];
const user = findById(users, 1);
```

<details>
<summary>üîç Click to see explanation</summary>

**What to say:**
"This is a generic function that can work with any type T, but with a constraint that T must have an id property of type number. The function takes an array of items and an id, then uses the find method to return the first item that matches the given id, or undefined if not found. The generic makes it reusable for different object types as long as they have an id property."

**Key points to mention:**
- Generic syntax `<T>`
- Type constraint `extends { id: number }`
- Array.find method
- Union type return `T | undefined`
</details>

### Example 5: Class with Inheritance
```typescript
abstract class Animal {
  constructor(public name: string) {}
  abstract makeSound(): string;
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  makeSound(): string {
    return `${this.name} says Woof!`;
  }
}

const dog = new Dog("Buddy");
console.log(dog.makeSound());
```

<details>
<summary>üîç Click to see explanation</summary>

**What to say:**
"This shows class inheritance in TypeScript. Animal is an abstract class that cannot be instantiated directly. It has a constructor that takes a name parameter (using the public shorthand to automatically create a property), and an abstract makeSound method that must be implemented by subclasses. Dog extends Animal and provides the required makeSound implementation. When we create a Dog instance and call makeSound(), it will output 'Buddy says Woof!'"

**Key points to mention:**
- Abstract class cannot be instantiated
- Public parameter shorthand
- Method implementation requirement
- Template string usage
</details>

### Example 6: Array Methods Chain
```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
const result = numbers
  .filter(n => n % 2 === 0)
  .map(n => n * 2)
  .reduce((sum, n) => sum + n, 0);

console.log(result); // What will this output?
```

<details>
<summary>üîç Click to see explanation</summary>

**What to say:**
"This is a method chain that processes the array in three steps. First, filter keeps only even numbers (2, 4, 6). Then map doubles each remaining number, giving us [4, 8, 12]. Finally, reduce sums all values starting from 0, so 0 + 4 + 8 + 12 = 24. The result will be 24."

**Key points to mention:**
- Method chaining
- Filter for selection
- Map for transformation
- Reduce for aggregation
- Arrow function syntax
</details>

## üî¥ **ADVANCED LEVEL** - Complex Patterns

### Example 7: Promise and Async/Await
```typescript
async function fetchUserData(userId: number): Promise<{ name: string; email: string }> {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(`/api/users/${userId}`);
    const userData = await response.json();
    return userData;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching user:', error);
    throw error;
  }
}

// Usage
fetchUserData(1).then(user => console.log(user.name));
```

<details>
<summary>üîç Click to see explanation</summary>

**What to say:**
"This is an async function that fetches user data from an API. It returns a Promise that resolves to an object with name and email properties. Inside, it uses await to handle the asynchronous fetch operation and JSON parsing. The try-catch block handles any errors that might occur during the API call. The function can be called with .then() or with await in another async function."

**Key points to mention:**
- Async/await syntax
- Promise return type
- Error handling with try-catch
- API interaction pattern
</details>

### Example 8: Type Guards and Union Types
```typescript
type User = {
  type: 'user';
  name: string;
  taskCount: number;
}

type Admin = {
  type: 'admin';
  name: string;
  permissions: string[];
}

function isAdmin(person: User | Admin): person is Admin {
  return person.type === 'admin';
}

function processUser(person: User | Admin) {
  if (isAdmin(person)) {
    console.log(person.permissions); // TypeScript knows this is Admin
  } else {
    console.log(person.taskCount); // TypeScript knows this is User
  }
}
```

<details>
<summary>üîç Click to see explanation</summary>

**What to say:**
"This demonstrates discriminated unions and type guards. We have two types, User and Admin, each with a 'type' property that acts as a discriminator. The isAdmin function is a type guard that checks the type property and tells TypeScript what type we're dealing with. In processUser, after the type guard check, TypeScript automatically knows which properties are available - permissions for Admin or taskCount for User."

**Key points to mention:**
- Union types with `|`
- Discriminated unions with literal types
- Type guard function with `is` keyword
- Type narrowing after guard check
</details>

### Example 9: Higher-Order Function
```javascript
function createMultiplier(factor) {
  return function(number) {
    return number * factor;
  };
}

const double = createMultiplier(2);
const triple = createMultiplier(3);

console.log(double(5)); // What will this output?
console.log(triple(4)); // And this?
```

<details>
<summary>üîç Click to see explanation</summary>

**What to say:**
"This is a higher-order function that returns another function. createMultiplier takes a factor and returns a new function that multiplies its input by that factor. This demonstrates closure - the returned function 'remembers' the factor value even after createMultiplier has finished executing. double(5) will return 10 (5 * 2), and triple(4) will return 12 (4 * 3)."

**Key points to mention:**
- Higher-order function (function that returns function)
- Closure concept
- Function factory pattern
- Lexical scoping
</details>

## üéØ **INTERVIEW SIMULATION**

### Practice Scenario 1
*"Can you explain what this TypeScript code does?"*

```typescript
interface ApiResponse<T> {
  data: T;
  status: number;
  message: string;
}

function handleApiResponse<T>(response: ApiResponse<T>): T | null {
  if (response.status === 200) {
    return response.data;
  }
  console.error(response.message);
  return null;
}
```

### Practice Scenario 2
*"Walk me through this JavaScript code step by step:"*

```javascript
const users = [
  { name: 'Alice', age: 25, active: true },
  { name: 'Bob', age: 30, active: false },
  { name: 'Charlie', age: 35, active: true }
];

const activeUserNames = users
  .filter(user => user.active)
  .map(user => user.name)
  .join(', ');
```

### Practice Scenario 3
*"What's happening in this code and what will it output?"*

```typescript
class Calculator {
  private history: number[] = [];
  
  add(a: number, b: number): number {
    const result = a + b;
    this.history.push(result);
    return result;
  }
  
  getHistory(): readonly number[] {
    return this.history;
  }
}

const calc = new Calculator();
console.log(calc.add(2, 3));
console.log(calc.getHistory());
```

## üí° **Interview Success Tips**

### When You See Code:
1. **Take 10 seconds** to read it completely
2. **Start with**: "This code is doing..."
3. **Go line by line** if it's complex
4. **Mention the purpose**: "The goal is to..."
5. **Point out key concepts**: "This uses TypeScript generics..." or "This demonstrates closure..."

### If You're Unsure:
- **Say what you do know**: "I can see this is a function that takes parameters..."
- **Make educated guesses**: "I think this might be trying to..."
- **Ask for clarification**: "Is this meant to handle error cases?"

### Red Flags to Avoid:
- ‚ùå Saying "I don't know" without trying
- ‚ùå Making up completely wrong explanations
- ‚ùå Getting stuck on syntax instead of explaining logic
- ‚ùå Not speaking at all while thinking

### Green Flags:
- ‚úÖ Breaking down complex code into parts
- ‚úÖ Explaining the "why" not just the "what"
- ‚úÖ Mentioning benefits of the approach
- ‚úÖ Connecting to real-world use cases

Remember: **They want to see how you think, not just what you know!** üß†‚ú®
